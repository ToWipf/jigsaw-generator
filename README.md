# Jigsaw generator

This is a small experiment where jigsaw puzzles are randomly generated.

We focus on regular grids, where all pieces are squares of the same size.
A piece has 4 edges, selected from a small set of shapes, namely edge types.
By design, adjacent pieces must have complementary edge types.
Having only a few edge types increases the combinations, as more pieces can connect together.

Moreover, the goal is to make apictoral jigsaw puzzles out of transparent acrylic.
This means that front and back faces cannot be distinguished by looking at the piece.
In practice, this not only increases the number of combinations, it also requires a different intuition from usual puzzles.

The main design constraint is to have exactly one solution, if we ignore the rotation and flip of the whole board.
This property opens various strategies, as well as making the problem well defined (i.e. you search THE solution).
However, proving that there is a single solution is likely to be NP-hard.
Hence, the approach here is to brute force all combinations, effectively counting them.


## Getting started

The entry point is [`src/main.cpp`](src/main.cpp), which you will need to tweak according to your needs.
In its current form, this is a multithreaded infinite loop, which outputs JSON lines to the standard output.
Each line is a single jigsaw puzzle, guaranteed to have a single solution.

 1. First, a set of edge types is selected.
    See [`src/piece.h`](src/piece.h) for the actual definition, which is mainly a matter of how types can be combined.
 2. Then, a grid of desired size is created and edges are randomized.
    By design, this jigsaw puzzle has a solution.
 3. Finally, an exhaustive search is done to count how many solutions exist.
    There are usually 8 possible transformations of a board (4 rotations, 2 sides).
    Therefore, having more than that means the solution is not unique.

A Python script, [`src/svg.py`](src/svg.py), is available to generate a SVG.


## Examples

```
[[[4, 0, 0, 5], [5, 0, 3, 3], [4, 0, 6, 6], [0, 0, 3, 3]], [[3, 6, 0, 4], [6, 4, 4, 5], [6, 5, 5, 5], [0, 4, 5, 3]], [[4, 3, 0, 6], [4, 6, 3, 6], [3, 6, 3, 5], [0, 4, 4, 5]], [[6, 5, 0, 0], [4, 5, 5, 0], [3, 6, 3, 0], [0, 6, 4, 0]]]
```
